# PrismarineBE Multiversion
Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software

I have to do this, but not yet. Now you can use only master branch

# How can i start my server?
Very easy! Just create a new folder and extract the contents of the archive into it.
Then enter the command 'chmod +x start.sh' in the terminal.
Then, then you have this all, you have to enter the command './start.sh'
Its all! Enjoy using it! ;)
